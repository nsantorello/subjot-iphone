iPhone Roadmap:

* User detail API call
* Jot detail view lets you comment
* Some way to delete your own comments? (if you select your own comment, it asks you if you want to delete it instead of bringing you to that person's profile)
* Lets you jot from the top right nav bar button with your subjects
=> 0.3

* Explore API calls
* Explore page has a search box (or search table entries) at the top to search for a specific subject, user, or word... or maybe a search tab?
* Embedly to embed video, photos, and music
=> 0.4

* iPhone home screen grouping action to reveal actions to see that user's profile, all their jots on X subject, all jots on X subject
* In stream view, a side swipe that lets you unfollow a user completely and unfollow them on a subject; also delete a jot if it's your jot
=> 0.5

* Notifications that take you to appropriate jot/comment
=> 0.6

* Able to edit your own profile
=> 0.7

* Caching and cache scheduling in settings--options for how long to cache jots/home many jots/how far back and to cache images, jots, comments, and user info (option for only if on WiFi for images) -- now we can read in the subway!  :)
* Posting comments and jots gets queued when you have no net connection
* Twitter-like visual notification to let you know that you have new notifications
=> 0.8

* Sharing jots to Twitter and FB (FML)
=> 0.9

* Graphical polish
=> 1.0

Tentative:
* Include tracking so that we can look at usage statistics in the app; e.g. how many people click on notifications in the notifications tab, track redundant tasks, etc
